DETAILED GITHUB INSTRUCTIONS WITH SCREENSHOTS

STEP 1: CREATE A GITHUB ACCOUNT (Skip if you already have one)
- Go to https://github.com
- Click "Sign up" in the top right corner
- Follow the registration process with your email

STEP 2: CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY
- After logging in to GitHub, look at the top-right corner of the page
- Click on the "+" icon (plus sign)
- Select "New repository" from the dropdown menu
- On the "Create a new repository" page:
  * Enter "medicare-website" as the Repository name
  * (Optional) Add a description like "A medical healthcare website"
  * Choose Public (anyone can see) or Private (only you can see)
  * DO NOT check "Add a README file" or any other options
  * Click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom

STEP 3: CONNECT YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY
- After creating the repository, you'll see a "Quick setup" page
- Look for the section titled "…or push an existing repository from the command line"
- Copy the two commands shown there, which look like:
  
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/medicare-website.git
  git push -u origin main

- Open your terminal in TRAI AI and paste these commands one by one
- For the first command: git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/medicare-website.git
- For the second command: git push -u origin main
- You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password
  * When prompted for username, type your GitHub username and press Enter
  * When prompted for password, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your regular password
  * The password field won't show any characters as you type (no asterisks) for security reasons

STEP 4: ENABLE GITHUB PAGES (To make your website live online)
- After pushing your code, go to your repository page on GitHub
- Click on "Settings" (tab with gear icon) near the top of the page
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section (or look for it in the left sidebar)
- Under "Source", click the dropdown that says "None" and select "main"
- Click "Save"
- After a few minutes, you'll see a message saying "Your site is published at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/medicare-website/"
- This is the URL you can share in your WhatsApp group

STEP 5: SHARE YOUR WEBSITE
- Copy either:
  * Your repository URL: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/medicare-website
  * Your live website URL: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/medicare-website
- Paste this URL in your WhatsApp group
- Add a message like "Check out our new medical healthcare website!"

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you're asked for credentials when pushing, you may need to create a personal access token:
  * Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
  * Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
  * Give it a name, set expiration, and check "repo" permissions
  * Click "Generate token" and copy the token
  * Use this token instead of your password when prompted

ABOUT IMAGES AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES
- All images in your website now use embedded SVG data URIs instead of external placeholder images
- This ensures your website works without internet connection and loads faster
- When adding new images to your website in the future, consider:
  * Using relative paths to images stored in your repository (e.g., "images/logo.png")
  * Using data URIs for small images (as we've done)
  * Hosting larger images on a dedicated image hosting service
